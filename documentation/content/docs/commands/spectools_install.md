## spectools install

Installs the dependencies

### Synopsis

Installs the configured dependencies from the .spectools config.

Enter the name of the repository and a tag or branch to install. If you want latest (not recommended) add **main** (**master**). 

    dependencies:
      - "git@github.com:theNorstroem/furoBaseSpecs.git v1.10.9"

It is up to you to add the dependencies to your version control system. We strongly recommend this if you work with packages that are not owned by 
your organisation. You can compare this with vendoring in golang.



```
spectools install [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -f, --fresh   rebuild the package directories
  -h, --help    help for install
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string   config file (default is CWD/.spectools.yaml)
```
