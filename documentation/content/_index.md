## Stay In Sync

The different specification formats can be used as a source or a sink or both of them. Some have a higher information 
density, furo spectools can keep them in sync for you.

## Multiple Sources Of Truth Supported
You have the choice from multiple definition formats as your source of truth.
This can be *.proto or one of the FIDLs (µSpec, spec). 

[Read more here](/docs/sourceoftruth/), to find out what fits best for you.

## Extendable

Furo FIDLs comes with a lot of extension points. You can add your extensions at type level, field level and services. 
The extensions can be used by *your* generators or scripts.

## Configurable Flows
The commands of spectools can be configured as **flows** (chain of commands). You can also add your custom commands and 
add them at any point to your flow.
