	Use:   "muSpec2Spec",
	Short: "Updates the type specs with the definitions from the type µSpecs.",

Do not forget to set your µSpec folder in the .spectools config.`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// muSpec2SpecCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	muSpec2SpecCmd.Flags().BoolP("delete", "d", false, "Delete specs which are not in muTypes")
}
